### Notes
Unforunately, I had trouble loading the poster images from the URL. I installed the installed cocoapods, added AlamofireImage as a pod, was able to import 
AlamofireImage into my project, and using UIImgView.af.setImage(url: imgURL!), however the poster would not load. I also printed the URL of each image to the console to make
sure there was not an error when parsing the baseURL with the imageURL. When checking the URL printed on a web browser, the correct movie poster would display.
I am unsure what the issue is, and will be addressing this issue with one of the tech gurus. <br><br>
